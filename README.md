YouTube maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. This data set includes several months of data on daily trending YouTube videos. Data is included for the USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, France, Russia, Mexico, South Korea, India and Japan. This list is determined by using user interactions such as views, comments and likes to identify which videos are user preferred and displays them on the trending page. Ranking of these videos is done based on a ratio of views, likes, comments and shares, in order to display the best videos at the top of the page. We used the data sets available and began the process of data cleaning followed by Exploratory data analysis (EDA). 

**This project will be divided into two sessions as follows**
